# Job Shop Schedule Problem

## Todo
- [ ] UML diagram describing classes and their relationships.
- [x] Flow diagram describing steps of our program.
- [x] Create solution class. As of right now a solution is just a list of operation objects.
- [ ] Create initialSolutionFactory class for generating feasible initial solutions.
- [ ] Redo myset class in tabuSearch.py. The list implementation is not efficient.
- [ ] Finish tabuSearch class (i.e. implement the pseudocode we have for TS).
